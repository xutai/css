            <pre class="question">
                ???One issue that arises 
                when you have a fixed amount of width or height in your layout is that 
                eventually your flexbox children will overflow their container, breaking the layout. 
            </pre>
            <pre>
                flex-wrap: wrap (flex container)
                flex: 200; (flex items)
                    each will be at least 200px wide
                        You might also notice that the last few children on the last row are each made wider 
                        so that the entire row is still filled.
        
                备注，在没有flex-wrap:wrap应用的时候，flex items的宽度好像没有达到200，但是flex items的高度好像达到了一定的长度
        
                flex-direction: row-reverse
                    you still have your multiple row layout

                    unitless proportion value   portion n. 部分；一份；
                    dictates how much of the available space along the main axis
                    each flex item will take up compared to other flex items
        
                    giving each article element the same value (a value of 1)
                    which means they will all take up an equal amount of the spare space left 
                    after things like padding and margin have been set
        
                    It is relative to other flex items, 
                    meaning that giving each flex item a value of 400000 would have exactly the same effect.
        
                flex: 2
                    takes up twice as much of the available width as the other two
                    there are now four proportion units available in total (since 1 + 1 + 2 = 4)
                    The first two flex items have one unit each so they take 1/4 of the available space each
                    The third one has two units, so it takes up 2/4 of the available space (or one-half).
        
                flex: 1 200px;
                flex: 2 200px;
                    Each flex item will first be given 200px of the available space
                    After that, the rest of the available space will be shared out according to the proportion units

            <h2>flex:shorthand versus longhand</h2>
            <pre>
                flex
                    flex-grow
                    flex-shrink
                        when the flex items are overflowing their container
                        This specifies how much of the overflowing amount is taken away from each flex item's size
                        to stop them overflowing their container
                    flex-basis
                        The minimum size value
        
                advise against using the longhand flex properties unless you really have to
                    (for example, to override something previously set)
                    They lead to a lot of extra code being written, and they can be somewhat confusing.
                so better us longhand!

            <h2>horizontal and vertical alignment</h2>
            <pre>

                align-items: (flex container) - cross axis
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items</a>
                    stretch (default)
                        stretches all flex items to fill the parent in the direction of the cross axis
                            If the parent hasn't got a fixed width in the cross axis direction, then all flex items will become as long as the longest flex items.
                                This is how our first example got equal height columns by default.
                    center
                        to maintain their intrinsic dimensions, but be centered along the cross axis. 
                            This is why our current example's buttons are centered vertically.
                    flex-start, flex-end
                        which will align all items at the start and end of the cross axis respectively
                    
                align-self: (flex items)   - cross axis
                    override the align-items behavior for individual flex items 
        
                    flex-start, flex-end etc



                align-content:  
                sets the distribution of space between and around content items along a flexbox's cross-axis or a grid's block axis.
                https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-content



                justify-items:
                defines the default justify-self for all items of the box, giving them all a default way of justifying each box along the appropriate axis.
                https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-items
        
                justify-content: (flex container) - main axis
                    controls where the flex items sit on the main axis.
        
                    flex-start (default)
                        makes all the items sit at the start of the main axis.
                    flex-end
                    center
                        make the flex items sit in the center of the main axis.
                    space-around
                        it distributes all the items evenly along the main axis, 
                        with a bit of space left at either end.
                    space-between
                        which is very similar to space-around except that 
                        it doesn't leave any space at either end.
            </pre>

            <h2>ordering flex items</h2>
            <pre>
                Flexbox also has a feature for changing the layout order of flex items, 
                without affecting the source order.
                    This is another thing that is impossible to do with traditional layout methods.
        
                order: 1
        
                By default, all flex items have an order value of 0.
                Flex items with higher order values set on them will appear later in the display order than items with lower order values.
                Flex items with the same order value will appear in their source order. 
                    So if you have four items with order values of 2, 1, 1, and 0 set on them respectively, their display order would be 4th, 2nd, 3rd, then 1st.
                The 3rd item appears after the 2nd because it has the same order value and is after it in the source order.
        
                order: -1
                    for this exmple, appear at the start of the main axis 
            </pre>

            <h2>nested flex boxes</h2>
            <pre>
                flex:  1 auto;
                    try resizing your browser window width.
        
                    The buttons will take up as much space as they can 
                    and sit as many on the same line as they can,
        
                    but when they can no longer fit comfortably on the same line, 
                    they'll drop down to create new lines.
            </pre>

            <h2>cross brower compatibility</h2>
            <pre>
                Flexbox support is available in most new browsers
                    Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge and IE 11, newer versions of Android/iOS, etc
        
                However you should be aware that there are still older browsers in use that don't support Flexbox 
                (or do, but support a really old, out-of-date version of it.)
        
                using flexbox in a real website you need to do testing and make sure that your user experience is still acceptable in as many browsers as possible.
        
                Flexbox is a bit trickier than some CSS features.
                    For example, if a browser is missing a CSS drop shadow, then the site will likely still be usable.
                    Not supporting flexbox features however will probably break a layout completely, making it unusable.
