    <h1>grids</h1>
    <p>two-dimensional 二维 layout system for the web <br>
        It lets you lay content out in rows and columns, and has many features that make building complex layouts
        straightforward. </p>


    <h2>what is grid layout?</h2>
    <p>A grid: is a collection of horizontal and vertical lines creating a pattern against 依靠 which we can line up our design elements</p>
    <pre>
        gutter 槽
    </pre>



    <h2>creating your grid in css</h2>

    <h3>defining a grid</h3>
    <pre>
        display: grid; (container)
            gives you a one column grid
                so your items will continue to display one below the other as they do in normal flow.
        grid-template-coloumns: 200px 200px 200px;   (container)
            3 columns

    </pre>

    <h3>flexible grids with fr unit</h3>
    <pre>
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr
            fr fraction 部分
            fr: represents one fraction of the <strong>available space</strong> in the grid container.
                vs lengths, percentage
            The fr unit distributes space in proportion 比例,
                grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr

            <strong>available space not all space</strong>
                Therefore if one of your tracks has something large inside it 
                there will be less free space to share out.
    </pre>

    <h3>gaps between tracks</h3>
    <pre>
        grid-column-gap (container)
        grid-row-gap (container)

        grid-gap: alias,
            the intention is to make them usable in multiple layout methods
            will be safe to use for some time
        gap

        grid-gap followedby gap
            To be on the safe side
    </pre>

    <h3>repeating track listings</h3>
    <pre>
        grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr)
            3 1fr tracks
            how many times you want the listing to repeat | a track listing, which may be one or more tracks that you want to repeat
    </pre>

    <h3>the implicit and explicit grid</h3>
    <pre>
        explicit
            grid-template-columns or
            grid-template-rows
        implicit
            when content is placed outside of that grid 
                such as into our rows

        The explicit and implicit grids are analogous to the main and cross flexbox axes.
        
            By default, tracks created in the implicit grid are auto sized
                which in general means that they are large enough to fit their content

            If you wish to give implicit grid tracks a size you can use the 
                grid-auto-rows and 
                    If you add grid-auto-rows with a value of 100px to your CSS, 
                    you will see that those created rows are now 100 pixels tall.
                grid-auto-columns properties.
    </pre>

    <h3>the minmax() function</h3>
    <pre>
        grid-auto-rows: 100px;
            won’t be very useful if we add content into those tracks that is taller than 100 pixels, in which case it would cause an overflow

        -> change to 

        grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto)
            at least 100 pixels tall and can still expand if more content gets into them

            A fairly basic fact about the web is that you never really know how tall something is going to be
                additional content or larger font sizes can cause problems with designs that attempt to be pixel perfect in every dimension.

        
    </pre>

    <h3>as many columns as will fit</h3>
    <pre>
        grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
    </pre>



    <h2>line-based placement</h2>
    <pre>
        grid-column
            grid-coloum-start
            grid-column-end
        grid-row
            grid-row-start
            grid-row-end
        /, 


        -1 end column end row, for explicit grid not implicit grid
    </pre>

    
    <h2>positioning with grid-template-areas</h2>
    <pre>
        grid-template-areas: {

            "header header"
            "sidebar content"
            "footer footer"
        }
        header {
            grid-area: header
        }
        etc...


        rules:
            every cell filled
            span cross just repeat name
            !To leave a cell empty, use a . (period).
            rectangular  矩形的
            !Areas can't be repeated in different locations.
    </pre>


    <h2>a css grid, grid framework</h2>
    <pre>
        Grid "frameworks" tend to be based around 12 or 16 column grids
        line-based placement
    </pre>
