        <h2>how are elements laid out by default?</h2>
        <pre>
            el box laid out: content - padding - border - margin (box model)

            block level element vs inline elements
                100% width of its parent element | as wide as their content
                as tall as its content | as tall as their content
                can set width and height | can't set width and height (they just sit inside <strong>the content</strong> of block level elements)
                    inline elements - display: block or inline-block - behave like a block level element, mixed characteristics from both
                
            the normal layout flow:
                is the system by which elements are placed inside the browser's viewport

                block-level elements
                    By default, block-level elements are laid out in the block flow direction, 
                    based on the parent's writing mode (initial: horizontal-tb) — 
                    each one will appear on a new line below the last one, 
                    and they will be separated by any margin that is set on them.
                    In English therefore, or any other horizontal, top to bottom writing mode, 
                    block-level elements are laid out vertically.
                inline elements
                    Inline elements behave differently — they don't appear on new lines;
                    instead, they sit on the same line as one another and any adjacent (or wrapped) text content, 
                    as long as there is space for them to do so inside <strong>the width?</strong> of the parent block level element. 
                    If there isn't space, then the overflowing text or elements will move down to a new line.
            
                margin collapsing
                    If two adjacent elements both have the margin set on them and the two margins touch,
                    the larger of the two remains, and the smaller one disappears
