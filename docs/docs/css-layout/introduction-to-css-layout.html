    <h1>introduction to css layout</h1>
    <section>
        <p>CSS page layout techniques:
            allow us to take elements contained in a web page
            and control where they are positioned relative to their default position in normal layout flow,
            the other elements around them, their parent container, or the main viewport/window.
        </p>

    <h2 id="normal-flow">normal flow</h2>
    <section>
        <p>normal flow:  how the browser lays out HTML pages by default when you do nothing to control page layout</p>
        <p>block elements, inline elements, block direction, inline direction, writting mode</p>
        <p>well-structured HTML document</p>
        <p>methods: the display property, floats, the position property, table layout, multi-column layout</p>
    </section>

    <h2>the display property</h2>
    <p>display: none, block, inline, inline-block, flex, grid</p>

    <h2>flexbox</h2>
    <p>flexbox: flexible box layout 伸缩盒子布局<br>
        flexible adj. 弹性; 灵活的；柔韧的；易弯曲的 <br>
        lay things out in one dimension <br>
        display: flex, to the parent element of the elements  
    </p>
    <pre>
        display: flex
            flex-direction: row
                They are displayed in a row
                The items all line up at the start of the container, leaving any extra space at the end of the row.
            align-items: stretch
                They all appear to stretch to the height of the tallest item
                the items stretch to the height of the flex container, which in this case is defined by the tallest item.
    </pre>
    <p>flex property, to all of our child items <br>
        change the way that the items flex, enabling them to expand and contract to fit into the available space <br>
        flex vi. 弯曲；收缩 contract v. 收缩，缩短；
    </p>
    <pre>
        flex: 1
            all of the items to grow and fill the container, rather than leaving space at the end
                If there is more space then the items will become wider
                if there is less space they will become narrower
                if you add another element to the markup the items will all become smaller to make space for it
                    they will adjust size to take up the same amount of space, whatever that is.
    </pre>

    <h2>grid layout</h2>
    <p>grid layout: lining things up in rows and columns. <br>
    two dimensions
    </p>
    <pre>
        a simple example: relying on the auto-placement behavior

        display: grid  (container, parent element)
            grid-template-row: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
                three columns each of 1fr
            grid-template-columns: 100px 100px;
                two rows of 100px
            grid-gap: 10px

        no necessary properties for (child elements)


        a example: explicitly place your items (child elements)
            grid-column: 2 / 4; 
            (3 cols) 分成3块，4条线
                grid-column-start:  2;
                    start from line 2
                grid-column-end: 4;
                    end from line 4
            grid-column: 1
                col 1
            grid-column: 3
                col 3
            grid-row: 1;
            (2 rows) 2块，3条线
                will take up 1 row
                row 1
            grid-row: 2
                row 2
    </pre>

    <h2>floats</h2>
    <p>Floating an element changes the behavior of that element and the block level elements that follow it in normal flow. <br>
        The element is moved to the left or right and removed from normal flow, and the surrounding content floats around the floated item. <br>
        float:left, right, none, inherit
    </p>
    <pre>
        float a div left,  
        and give a margin on the right to push the text away from the element
            This gives us the effect of text wrapped around that box, 
                and is most of what you need to know about floats as used in modern web design.
    </pre>


    <h2>positioning techniques</h2>
    <section>
        <p>static(default), relative, absolute, fixed, sticky </p>
        <ul>
            <li>static: default, normal potion in the document layout flow</li>
            <li>relative: relative to its position in normal flow <br>
                including making it overlap other elements on the page
            </li>
            <li>absolute: completely out of the page's normal layout flow, like it is sitting on its own separate layer. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; fix it in a position relative to the edges of the page's html element  (or its nearest positioned ancestor element). <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; creating complex layout effects such as tabbed adj. 选项卡式的；分页式的 boxes, where different content panels sit on top of one another and are shown and hidden as desired, <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; or information panels that sit off screen by default, but can be made to slide on screen using a control button.
            </li>
            <li>fixed: very similar to absolute positioning, except that it fixes an element relative to the <strong> browser viewport</strong>, not another element. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;creating effects such as a persistent navigation menu that always stays in the same place on the screen as the rest of the content scrolls.
            </li>
            <li>sticky:  a newer positioning method which makes an element act like position: static until it hits a defined offset from the viewport, at which point it acts like position: fixed.</li>

        </ul>
    </section>
    <h3>simple positioning example</h3>
    <p>use width, padding, margin etc</p>

    <h3>relative positioning</h3>
    <p>allows you to offset an item from the position in normal flow <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;moving an icon down a bit so it lines up with a text label <br>
        position: relative; |  this doesn't do anything on its own <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; top, left properties
    </p>

    <h3>absolute positioning</h3>
    <p>completely remove an element from normal flow, and place it using offsets from the edges of a containing block <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;container!
    </p>

    <h3>fixed positioning</h3>
    <p>removes our element from document flow in the same way as absolute positioning <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;the viewport!
    </p>
    <h3>sticky positioning</h3>
    <p>It mixes the default static positioning with fixed positioning <br>
        When an item has position: sticky it will scroll in normal flow until it hits offsets from the viewport that we have defined. At that point it becomes "stuck" as if it had position: fixed applied.
    </p>


    <h2 id="table-layout">table layout</h2>
    <section>
        <p>tabular data. inflexible, very heavy on markup, difficult to debug, and semantically wrong (e.g., screen reader users have problems navigating table layouts)</p>
        <p>using CSS tables: The way that a table looks on a webpage when you use table markup is due to a set of CSS properties that define table layout.
            These properties can be used to lay out elements that are not tables <br>
            legacy method | for those situations where you have very old browsers without support for Flexbox or Grid
        </p>
        <pre>
            display: table-caption | like caption el; 
            caption-side: bottom; 
            display: table-row; | tr
            display: table-cell; | td
        </pre>

    </section>

    <h2>multi-column layout</h2>
    <section>
        <p>lay out content in columns, similar to how text flows in a newspaper. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;While reading up and down columns is less useful in a web context as you don’t want to force users to scroll up and down, arranging content into columns can be a useful technique.
        </p>
        <pre>
            column-count:
                tells the browser how many columns we would like to have
            column-width:
                tells the browser to fill the container with as many columns of at least that width
        </pre>
    </section>
