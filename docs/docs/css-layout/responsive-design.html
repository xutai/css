                    responsive web design isn't a separate technology <br>
                    it is a term used to describe an approach to web design or a set of best practices, used to create a
                    layout that can respond to the device being used to view the content. <br>
                    In Marcotte's original exploration this meant <strong>flexible grids (using floats) and media
                        queries</strong>

                <h2>media queries</h2>
                <p>specification lv3 candidate recommendation 2009 <br>
                    run a series of tests (e.g. whether the user's screen is greater than a certain width, or a certain
                    resolution) and apply CSS selectively to style the page appropriately for the user's needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    the following media query tests to see if the current web page is being displayed as <strong>screen
                        media</strong> (therefore not a <strong>printed document</strong> )
                    and the viewport is at least 800 pixels wide. <br>

                    A common approach <br>
                    <strong>mobile first</strong> design <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;create a simple single-column layout for narrow-screen devices (e.g mobile phones) <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;then check for larger screens and implement a multiple-column layout when you know that
                    you have enough screen width to handle it.

                <h2>flexible-grids</h2>
                <p><strong>Responsive sites</strong> don't just change their layout between breakpoints, they are built
                    on flexible grids. </p>
                <p> <strong>A flexible grid</strong> means that you don't need to target every possible device size that
                    there is, and build a pixel perfect layout for it. That approach would be impossible given the vast
                    number of differently-sized devices that exist, and the fact that on desktop at least, people do not
                    always have their browser window maximized.</p>
                <p>By using a flexible grid, you only need to add in a breakpoint and change the design <strong>at the
                        point where the content starts to look bad</strong>.
                    For example, if the line lengths become unreadably long as the screen size increases, or a box
                    becomes squashed with two words on each line as it narrows.

                    <p>column-width: a minimum width. The browser will create as many columns of that width as will
                        comfortably fit into the container, then share out the remaining space between all the columns.

                <p>the simplest approach: max-width: 100%;</p>
                <p>1.The image might be displayed a lot smaller than its intrinsic size, which is a waste of bandwidth —
                    a mobile user may be downloading an image several times the size of what they actually see in the
                    browser window. </p>
                <p>2.you may not want the same image aspect ratio on mobile as on desktop. better a square image for
                    mobile, a landscape image on desktop </p>
                <p>&lt;picture&gt;, &lt;img&gt; srcset and sizes attributes solve both of these problems</p>
                <p>You can provide multiple sizes along with "hints"
                    <strong>(meta data that describes the screen size and resolution the image is best suited
                        for)</strong> ,
                    and the browser will choose the most appropriate image for each device,
                    ensuring that a user will download an image size appropriate for the device they are using.</p>
                <p>You can also <strong>art direct</strong> images used at different sizes, thus providing a different
                    crop or completely
                    different image to different screen sizes.</p>

                    <p>user loses the ability to zoom any text set using the vw unit, as that text is always related to
                        the size of the viewport</p>
                    <p><strong>Therefore you should never set text using viewport units alone.</strong></p>
                    <p>There is a solution, and it involves using calc(). If you add the vw unit to a value set using a
                        fixed size such as ems or rems then the text will still be zoomable. Essentially, the vw unit
                        adds on top of that zoomed value:</p>
                    <p>calc(1.5rem + 3vw)</p>
                    <p><strong>This means that we only need to specify the font size for the heading once</strong>,
                        rather than set it up for mobile and redefine it in the media queries. The font then gradually
                        increases as you increase the size of the viewport.</p>
