            <p>Positioning allows you to take elements out of the normal document layout flow, and make them behave
                differently</p>

            <section>
                <h2>introducing positioning</h2>
                <p>allow us to override the basic document flow behavior described above <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;sitting on top of one another <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;always remaining in the same place inside the browser viewport</p>
                <section id="static-positioning">
                    <h3>static positioning</h3>
                    <p>put the element into its normal position in the document layout flow</p>
                </section>
                <section id="relative-positioning">
                    <h3>relative positioning</h2>
                    <p>very similar to static positioning <br>
                        except that once the positioned element has taken its place in the normal layout flow, you can
                        then modify its final position <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;including making it overlap other elements on the page
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section id="introducing-top-bottom-left-and-right">

                <section id="absolute-positioning">
                    <h3>absolute positioning</h2>
                    <p>the gap where the positioned element should be in the document flow is no longer there, <br>
                        An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document layout flow <br>
                        it sits on its own layer separate from everything else <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;we can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the position of other
                        elements on the page <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;popup information boxes and control menus <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rollover panels <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UI features that can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the page
                        containing element
                    </p>
                    <p>my note: if no containing element (container, container's container etc..., go up until html
                        element) is set with "relative, absolute, fixed" etc,
                        or if they all are set with "static", then the html element wil lbe the containing element or
                        just the viewport? because its in a different layer
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>try top: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; right: 0, why setting bottom, and right ?</strong>,
                        look like this works for block element, it cover the whole layer, like whole html or viewport
                        <br>
                        the effect is so weird, it's not cover the document, or html or body, it's just hard to explain
                        <br>
                        the layer underneath looks like it's not possible to interact with</p>
                    <p>margins still affect positioned elements. Margin collapsing doesn't, however.</p>

                    contains the &lt;html&gt; element <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply put, the absolutely positioned element will be contained outside of
                    the &lt;html&gt; element, and be positioned relative to the initial viewport. </p>
                <p>positioning context: which element the absolutely positioned element is positioned relative to <br>

                    positioned heading no longer appears in the document flow, so the rest of the content moves up to

                    add margin to some element to change it</p>
                <p>why margin-top: 60px, because h1 element height of content 37.333 + margin-bottom 21.4333</p>

                    it is relatively positioned until it is scrolled to a certain threshold point, after which it becomes fixed <br>

                    <p>position: sticky along with top: 0, supporting browsers will stick the headings to the top of the viewport as they reach that position. <br>
                        Each subsequent header will then <strong>replace the previous one</strong> as it scrolls up to that position. <br>
                        by testing, looks like it can only replace the same element type, eg. h2 cannot replace h3, so they will stack up one another
