        <h1>styling links</h1>

        <h2>let's look at some links</h2>

        <h3>link states</h3>
        <pre>
            link (unvisited)
                default state
                :link
            visited
                visted(exists in browser's history)
                :visited
            hover
                hovered over by a user's mouse pointer
                :hover
            focus
                e.g. moved to by a keyboard user using the tab key or similar
                or programmatically focused using HTMLElement.focus()
                :focus
            active
                being activated
                e.g. clicked on
                :active
        </pre>
        <h3>default styles</h3>
        <pre>
            fake links
                # (hash, or pound sign) is put in place of the real URL
                # just links to the current page

            default styles:
                    underlined
                unvisited 
                    blue
                visited 
                    purple
                hovering
                    mouse pointer change to a little hand icon
                focused
                    outline
                    tab key (macos crtl+f7)
                active
                    red
                    (Try holding down the mouse button on the link as you click it.)

            at least:
                underlining or highlight them in some other way
                react when hovered or focused, a slightly differently way when activated

            default styles turned off/changed:
                color
                cursor
                    you shouldn't turn this off unless you've got a very good reason.
                outline
                    outline vs border
                    an outline is similar to a border
                    outline doesn't take up space in the box | border takes up space in the box
                    it just sits over the top of the background | 
                    userful accessibility aid |

                    at least double up the syltes given to the link hover, focus state 

            example
                to get rid of the default text underline and focus outline (which varies across browsers anyway

                border-bottom vs text-decoration: underline
                The underline has been created using border-bottom, not text-decoration — 
                some people prefer this because 
                the former has better styling options | than the latter, 
                and is drawn a bit lower, |
                so doesn't cut across the descenders of the word being underlined (e.g. the tails on g and y).
                cut across 抄近路通过；径直穿过；打断
                这句话是不是就是说他这个这个不会禁止穿过这个这个这些字母，就是说比如记或者外它的最下面的这个部分，

                The border-bottom value has been set as 1px solid, with no color specified
                makes the border adopt the same color as the element's text,
                which is useful in cases like this where the text is a different color in each case.

                inverted color scheme 
                color = background-color, background-color = color
        </pre>
        <h3>styling some links</h3>
        <pre>
            empty rulesets:
            a, 
            a:link,
            a:visited,
            a:focus,
            a:hover,
            a:active

            This order is important because the link styles build on one another
                the styles in the first rule will apply to all the subsequent ones
                when a link is being activated, it is also being hovered over
                If you put these in the wrong order, things won't work properly.
                To remember the order, you could try using a mnemonic like LoVe Fears HAte.
                mnemonic adj. 记忆的；助记的；记忆术的
                LVFHA - LoVe Fears HAte
                
        </pre>


        <h2>including icons on links</h2>
        <pre>
            and then specify the position as 100% of the way over to the right of the text content,


            We also use background-size to specify the size we want the background image to be shown at — 
            it is useful to have a larger icon and then resize it like this as needed for responsive web design purposes. 
            This does however only work with IE 9 and later, so if you need to support those older browsers, 
            you'll just have to resize the image and insert it as is.

                https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position
            background percentages
                The background-position CSS property sets the initial position for each background image. 
                The position is relative to the position layer set by background-origin.
            The percentage offset of the given background image's position is relative to the container.
                value of 0% means that the left (or top) edge of the background image is 
                aligned with the corresponding left (or top) edge of the container
                A value of 100% means that the right (or bottom) edge of the background image is 
                aligned with the right (or bottom) edge of the container

                (container width - image width) * (position x%) = (x offset value)

            background-origin
                https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-origin
                The background-origin CSS property sets the background's origin: 
                from the border start, inside the border, or inside the padding.

            how did we select just external links?
                you should only be using absolute URLs for external links
                    text "http" should therefore only appear in external links
                        attribute selector: a[href*="http"] selects a elements but only if they have an href attribute
                            *  means with a value that contains "http" somewhere inside it.
                it is more efficient to use relative links to link to other parts of your own site

                https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors
                [attr*=value]
                    Represents elements with an attribute name of attr 
                    whose value contains at least one occurrence of value within the string
        </pre>



        <h2>styling links as buttons</h2>
        <pre>


            0.625% * 4 = 2.5%
            19.5% * 5 =  97.5%

            why ul padding: 0;
                review default styles

                
            why li - inline, 
                causes the list items to sit on the same line as one another — they now behave like inline elements.
                to keep all li el in the same line, if not they will be in the next lines
                li default block

            why a - inline-block not a - inline?
                a elements are inline by default
                review box-model
                    review inline, inline-block, block
                    

            line-height
                relate to element font-size
                which also has the advantage of centering the text vertically



                
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Home</a></li><li><a href="#">Pizza</a></li><li><a href="#">Music</a></li><li><a href="#">Wombats</a></li><li><a href="#">Finland</a></li>
              </ul>
              
            spaces, line breaks 
                You may have noticed that the list items in the HTML are all put on the same line as each other 
                — this is done because spaces/line breaks in between inline block elements create spaces on the page, 
                just like the spaces in between words, and such spaces would break our horizontal navigation menu layout. 
                So we've removed the spaces.
