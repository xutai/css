        <h2>web fonts</h2>
        <pre>
            there is an alternative, which works very well, right back to IE version 6

            Web fonts are a CSS feature 
            that allows you to specify font files to be downloaded along with your website as it is accessed
            meaning that any browser that supports web fonts can have exactly the fonts you specify available to it

            @font-face {
                font-family: 'myFont';
                src: url()  local or remote
            }

            html {
                font-family: 'myFont', etc...
            }


            bear in mind:
                Browsers support different font formats, 
                so you'll need multiple font formats for decent cross-browser support
                    For example, most modern browsers support WOFF/WOFF2 (Web Open Font Format versions 1 and 2), the most efficient format around
                    but older versions of IE only support EOT (Embedded Open Type) fonts
                    and you might need to include an SVG version of the font to support older versions of iPhone and Android browsers

                Fonts generally aren't free to use
                    You have to pay for them, 
                    and/or follow other license conditions such as crediting the font creator in the code (or on your site)


            Note: Web fonts as a technology have been supported in Internet Explorer since version 4!

        <h2>active learning: a web font example</h2]>

        <h3>finding fonts</h3>
        <pre>
            three types of sites where you can obtain fonts:
                A free font distributor
                    Font Squirrel, dafont, and Everything Fonts.
                A paid font distributor
                    fonts.com or myfonts.com.
                    You can also buy fonts directly from font foundries, for example Linotype, Monotype, or Exljbris.
                An online font service
                    This is a site that stores and serves the fonts for you, making the whole process easier.
                        google fonts etc.

            two fonts, one for the headings, and one for the body text.
                headings
                    maybe a nice display or slab serif font  slab n. 厚板，平板；混凝土路面；厚片
                body text
                    slightly less flashy and more readable font   flashy adj. 俗丽的，浮华的；穿着奢华的；闪光的；瞬间的；暴躁的；炫耀技艺的

                It doesn't matter whether they are TTF (True Type Fonts) or OTF (Open Type Fonts)
                some fonts are distributed as a family with different variants available
                    for example thin, medium, bold, italic, thin italic
        </pre>

        <h3>generating the required code</h3>
        <pre>
            licensing
            websont generator
            upload fonts
            legally eligible for web embedding
            download your kit

        </pre>

        <h3>implementing the code in your demo</h3>
        <pre>
            Multiple versions of each font
                for example .ttf, .woff, .woff2, etc
                the exact fonts provided will be updated over time as browser support requirements change
                As mentioned above, multiple fonts are needed for cross browser support
                this is Fontsquirrel's way of making sure you've got everything you need.
            A demo HTML file for each font
                load these in your browser to see what the font will look like in different usage contexts.
            A stylesheet.css file
                which contains the generated @font-face code you'll need


            implement these fonts in your demo
                different fonts are created at different sizes, you may have to adjust the size, spacing, etc.
        </pre>




        <h2>using an online font service</h2>
        <pre>
            Online font services generally store and serve fonts for you
                so you don't have to worry about writing the @font-face code
                and generally just need to insert a simple line or two of code into your site to make everything work
                    Adobe Fonts and Cloud.typography.
                Most of these services are subscription-based
                    with the notable exception of Google Fonts
                        a useful free service, especially for rapid testing work and writing demos.

        <h2>@font-face in more detail</h2>
        <pre>
            bulletproof @font-face syntax
                after a post by Paul Irish from early on when @font-face started to get popular
                bulletproof adj. 防弹的

                font-family
                    This line specifies the name you want to refer to the font as
                    anything you like
                    as long as you use it consistently throughout your CSS
                src
                    These lines specify 
                        the paths to the font files to be imported into your CSS (the url part)
                        the format of each font file (the format part)
                            optional
                            but it is useful to declare it because it allows browsers to find a font they can use faster
                    Multiple declarations can be listed, separated by commas
                        the browser will search through them and use the first one it can find that it understands
                        it is therefore best to put newer, better formats like WOFF2 earlier on, and older, not so good formats like TTF later on. 

                        The one exception to this is the EOT fonts 
                            they are placed first to fix a couple of bugs in older versions of IE 
                            whereby it will try to use the first thing it finds, 
                            even if it can't actually use the font.
                font-weight/font-style
                    These lines specify     
                        what weight the font has
                        whether it is italic or not

                        If you are importing multiple weights of the same font, you can specify what their weight/style is 
                        and then use different values of font-weight/font-style to choose between them,
                        rather than having to call all the different members of the font family different names.

                        @font-face tip: define font-weight and font-style to keep your CSS simple by Roger Johansson shows what to do in more detail.

                font-variant,
                font-stretch,
                unicode-range
                    which is a specific range of characters you want to use out of the web font
                    — in supporting browsers, only the specified characters will be downloaded, saving unnecessary downloading.
        </pre>


        <h2>variable fonts</h2>
        <pre>
            a newer font technology
                these are fonts that 
                    allow many different variations of a typeface to be incorporated into a single file
                    rather than having a separate font file for every width, weight, or style

            They are somewhat advanced for our beginner's course, 
            but if you fancy stretching yourself and looking into them, 
            read our Variable fonts guide.
