    <h1>fundamental text and font styling</h1>


    <h2>what is involved in styling text in css</h2>

    <pre>
        text inside an element is laid out inside the element's content box. 
        It starts at the top left of the content area 
        (or the top right, in the case of RTL language content)
        RTL?
        and flows towards the end of the line
        Once it reaches the end, it goes down to the next line and continues
        then the next line, 
        until all the content has been placed in the box.

        Text content effectively behaves like a series of inline elements,
        being laid out on lines adjacent to one another,
        and not creating line breaks until the end of the line is reached
        or unless you force a line break manually using the br element.

        box-model


        font styles
            Properties that affect the font that is applied to the text, 
            affecting what font is applied, 
            how big it is, 
            whether it is bold, 
            italic, etc.
        text layout styles
            Properties that affect the spacing and other layout features of the text, 
            allowing manipulation of, 
            for example, the space between lines and letters, 
            and how the text is aligned within the content box.


        !important concept
        Bear in mind that the text inside an element is all affected as one single entity. 
        You can't select and style subsections of text unless you wrap them in an appropriate element
        such as span or strong
        or use a text-specific pseudo-element like ::first-letter (selects the first letter of an element's text), ::first-line (selects the first line of an element's text), 
        or ::selection (selects the text currently highlighted by the cursor.)

    <pre>
        !important

        web safe fonts:
        Speaking of font availability, 
        there are only a certain number of fonts 
        that are generally available across all systems 
        and can therefore be used without much worry. 

        The problem is to find a way to know which font is available on the computer used to see our web pages
        There is no way to know this in every case
        but the web safe fonts are known to be available on nearly all instances of the most used operating systems

        name | generic type | notes
        Generic type 类属型

        name arial, | generic type sans-serif |
        It's often considered best practice to also add Helvetica as a preferred alternative to Arial as, 
        although their font faces are almost identical, 
        Helvetica is considered to have a nicer shape, even if Arial is more broadly available.

    <h4>font stacks</h4>
    <pre>
        font stack
        !important

        This simply involves a font-family value consisting of multiple font names separated by commas
        from left to right to check

        so thatthe browser has multiple fonts it can choose from

        Since you can't guarantee the availability of the fonts you want to use on your webpages
        (even a web font could fail for some reason)


        It is a good idea to provide a suitable generic font name at the end of the stack 
        so that if none of the listed fonts are available, 
        the browser can at least provide something approximately suitable.

        paragraphs are given the browser's default serif font if no other option is available
        which is usually Times New Roman (serif)
        this is no good for a sans-serif font! 
        no good for 对......没好处


        !important
        Font names that have more than one word — like Trebuchet MS — need to be surrounded by quotes, 
        for example "Trebuchet MS".

        sans-serif !== New Times Roman

    <h4>a font-family example</h4>

    <h3>font size</h3>
    <pre>
        px,

        em: 
            1 em is equal to the font size set on the parent element of the current element we are styling

            This can become tricky to work out if you have a lot of nested elements with different font sizes set
            but it is doable, as you'll see below. Why bother? 
            doable adj. 可做的
            It is quite natural once you get used to it, and you can use em to size everything, not just text.
            You can have an entire website sized using em, which makes maintenance easy.

        rems:
            except that 1 rem is equal to the font size set on the root element of the document
            html
            This makes doing the maths to work out your font sizes much easier
        
            browser suport
            although if you want to support really old browsers, you might struggle
            rem is not supported in Internet Explorer 8 and below.
        
        inheritance
            html 16px as standard across browsers
            Any paragraph (or another element that doesn't have a different size set by the browser)
                16px
            Other elements may have different default sizes
                h1 2em 32px

        altering the font size of nested elements
            Things become more tricky
            hard to calculate
            1.5em === 1.5 * 16 = 24, 1.5em(24px) * ? === 20px
            ? === 20/24 or 0.83333333 em
    </pre>
    <h4>a simple sizing example</h4>
    <pre>
        a good idea to set the base font-size of the document to 
        10 px
        so that then the maths is a lot easier to work out
    </pre>

    <h3>font style, font weight, text transform, and text decoration</h3>
    <pre>
        font-size:
            normal
                Sets the text to the normal font (turns existing italics off.)
            italic
                Sets the text to use the italic version of the font if available; 
                if not available, it will simulate italics with oblique instead.
            oblique 
                Sets the text to use a simulated version of an italic font, 
                created by slanting the normal version.
                oblique adj. 斜的； slanting adj. 倾斜的

        font-weight
            normal, bold
            lighter, bolder
                Sets the current element's boldness to be one step lighter or heavier 
                than its parent element's boldness.
            100-900

        text-transform
            none
                Prevents any transformation.
            uppercase
            lowercase
            capitalize
                Transforms all words to Have The First Letter Capitalized.
                <span class="capitalize">check this example</span>
            full-width
                Transforms all glyphs to be written inside a fixed-width square,
                glyph n. 字形；图象字符；纵沟纹
                similar to a monospace font,
                allowing aligning of e.g. Latin characters along with Asian language glyphs (like Chinese, Japanese, Korean).
                <span class="full-width">试试排列这段话把</span>

        text-decoration (shorthand)
            none
            underline
            overline
            line-through
                Puts a strikethrough over the text.

            can accept multiple values at once, add multiple decorations simultaneously
                for example text-decoration: underline overline

            longhand:

                text-decoration-line,
                text-decoration-style,
                text-decoration-color

    </pre>


    <h3>text drop shadows</h3>
    <pre>
        text-shadow: 4px 4px 5px red;

            horizontal offset
                This value has to be included.
            vertical offset
                This value has to be included.
            blur radius
                a higher value means the shadow is dispersed more widely
                disperse vt. 分散；使散开；传播
                If this value is not included, it defaults to 0,, which means no blur. 
            color
                If not included, it defaults to black.

    </pre>
    <h4>multiple shadows</h4>
    <pre>
        multiple shadows to the same text by 
        including multiple shadow values separated by commas


        text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px red,
             2px 2px 1px red;

             
    </pre>





    <h2>text layout</h2>

    <h3>text alignment</h3>
    <pre>
        text-align:
            left
            right
            center
            justify
                Makes the text spread out, varying the gaps in between the words, so that all lines of text are the same width.
                you need to use this carefully — it can look terrible, specially when applied to a paragraph with lots of long words in it. 
                If you are going to use this, you should also think about using something else along with it, such as <strong>hyphens</strong>,  to break some of the longer words across lines.
                https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hyphens
    </pre>

    <h3>line height</h3>
    <pre>
        line-height
            height of each line of text
            this can take most length and size units, but can also take a <strong>unitless value</strong>
            , which acts as a multiplier and is generally considered the best option — 
            <strong>the font-size is multiplied to get the line-height</strong>. 

            why should i set line-height?
            Body text generally looks nicer and is easier to read when the lines are spaced apart;
            <strong>the recommended line height is around 1.5 – 2 (double spaced.)</strong>

    </pre>

    <h3>letter and word spacing</h3>
    <pre>
        letter-spacing vs word-spacing
        spacing between letters | words

        you won't use these very often, but might find a use for them to get a certain look, or to improve the legibility of a particularly dense font.
