        <h1>styling lists</h1>

        <h2>a simple list example</h2>
        <pre>
            ol ordred list
            ul unordered list
                li list item
            dl description list (not data list)
                dt description term
                dd description description ?

            ul, ol    
                top-margin: 16px(1em), 
                bottom-margin: 16px(1em)
                padding-left: 40px(2.5em)

            li 
                have no set defaults for spacing

            dl 
                top-margin: 16px(1em), 
                bottom-margin: 16px(1em)
                no padding set

            dd 
                margin-left: 40px(2.5em)
            
            p 
                top-margin: 16px(1em), 
                bottom-margin: 16px(1em)

        </pre>


        <h2>handling list spacing</h2>
        <pre>
            adjust their styles so they keep the same vertical spacing as their surrounding elements 
            (such as paragraphs and images; sometimes called vertical rhythm),

            consistency
        </pre>


        <h2>list-specific styles</h2>
        <pre>
            list-style-type
                type of bullets to use for the list
                    square - unordered list
                    circle - unordered list
                    number - ordered list 
                    letter - ordered list
                    roman numeral - ordered list 
                    
            list-style-position
                bullets appear inside or outside the list items, before the start of each item

            list-style-image
                use a custom image for the bullet, rather than a simple square or circle.
        </pre>

        <h3>bullet styles</h3>
        <pre>
            list-style-type: upper-roman;
                ppercase roman numerals
        </pre>

        <h3>bullet position</h3>
        <pre>
            list-style-position
                inside
                outside
        </pre>

        <h3>using a custom bullet</h3>
        <pre>
            list-style-image
                url()

            vs background

            this property is a bit limited in terms of controlling the position, size, etc. | much better

            ul, ul li  padding-left: 2rem(20px);
            the list items are still lined up with the order list items and the description list descriptions
            but the list items have some padding for the background images to sit inside
            If we didn't do this, the background images would overlap with the list item text, 
            which would look messy.

            background-size 1.6rem(16px)
            We ideally want the bullets to be the same size as the list items (or very slightly smaller or larger).
            16px fits very nicely with the 20px padding
            16px plus 4px of space between the bullet and the list item text 

            background-repeat 
            By default,  repeat, background images repeat until they fill up the available background space.
            
        </pre>

        <h3>list-style shorthand</h3>
        <pre>
            list-style
                list-style-type
                    square
                list-style-image
                    url()
                list-style-position
                    inside

            list-style: squre url() inside
            the values can be listed in any order
            , and you can use one, two or all three
            (the default values used for the properties that are not included are disc, none, and outside).

            If both a type and an image are specified, 
            <strong>the type is used as a fallback</strong> if the image can't be loaded for some reason.
                    
        </pre>


        <h2>controlling list counting</h2>
        <pre>
            count differently on an ordered list 

            e.g. starting from a number other than 1, 
            or counting backwards, 
            or counting in steps of more than 1. 
        </pre>

        <h3>start</h3>
        <pre>
            The start attribute allows you to start the list counting from a number other than 1
        </pre>

        <h3>reversed</h3>
        <pre>
            If there are more list items in a reversed list than the value of the start attribute,
            the count will continue to zero and then into negative values. 
        </pre>

        <h3>value</h3>
        <pre>
            Even if you are using a non-number list-style-type, 
            you still need to use the equivalent numerical values in the value attribute.
        </pre>
