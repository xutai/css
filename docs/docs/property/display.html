<section>
    <p>The display CSS property sets whether an element is treated as a block or inline element and the layout used for
        its children, such as flow layout, grid or flex.</p>
    <p>Formally, the display property sets an element's inner and outer display types. The outer type sets an element's
        participation in flow layout; the inner type sets the layout of children. Some values of display are fully
        defined in their own individual specifications; for example the detail of what happens when display: flex is
        declared is defined in the CSS Flexible Box Model specification. See the table at the end of this document for
        all of the individual specifications.</p>

    <h2>Syntax</h2>
    <section>
        <h3>Outside</h3>
        <p>display-outside</p>
        <p>These keywords specify the element’s outer display type, which is essentially its role in flow layout.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>block</dt>
            <dd>The element generates a block element box, generating line breaks both before and after the element when
                in the normal flow.</dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
            <dt>inline</dt>
            <dd>The element generates one or more inline element boxes that do not generate line breaks before or after
                themselves. In normal flow, the next element will be on the same line if there is space</dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
            <dt>run-in</dt>
            <dd>The element generates a run-in box. If the adjacent sibling of the element defined as display: run-in
                box is a block box, the run-in box becomes the first inline box of the block box that follows it. </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Run-in elements act like inlines or blocks, depending on the surrounding elements. That is: If the run-in box
            contains a block box, same as block. If a block box follows the run-in box, the run-in box becomes the first
            inline box of the block box. If an inline box follows, the run-in box becomes a block box.</p>
        <p class="warning">Browsers that support the two value syntax, on finding the outer value only, such as when
            display: block or display: inline is specified, will set the inner value to flow. This will result in
            expected behavior; for example if you specify an element to be block, you would expect that the children of
            that element would participate in block and inline normal flow layout.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Inside</h3>
        <p>display-inside</p>
        <p>These keywords specify the element’s inner display type, which defines the type of formatting context that
            its contents are laid out in (assuming it is a non-replaced element).</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>flow</dt>
            <dd>The element lays out its contents using flow layout (block-and-inline layout).
                If its outer display type is inline or run-in, and it is participating in a block or inline formatting
                context, then it generates an inline box. Otherwise it generates a block container box.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Depending on the value of other properties (such as position, float, or overflow) and whether it is itself
            participating in a block or inline formatting context, it either establishes a new block formatting context
            (BFC) for its contents or integrates its contents into its parent formatting context.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>flow-root</dt>
            <dd>The element generates a block element box that establishes a new block formatting context, defining
                where the formatting root lies.</dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
            <dt>table</dt>
            <dd>These elements behave like HTML table elements. It defines a block-level box.</dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
            <dt>flex</dt>
            <dd>The element behaves like a block element and lays out its content according to the flexbox model.</dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
            <dt>grid</dt>
            <dd>The element behaves like a block element and lays out its content according to the grid model.</dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
            <dt>ruby</dt>
            <dd>The element behaves like an inline element and lays out its content according to the ruby formatting
                model. It behaves like the corresponding HTML ruby elements.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p class="warning">Browsers that support the two value syntax, on finding the inner value only, such as when
            display: flex or display: grid is specified, will set their outer value to block. This will result in
            expected behavior; for example if you specify an element to be display: grid, you would expect that the box
            created on the grid container would be a block level box.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>List Item</h3>
        <p>display-listitem</p>
        <p>The element generates a block box for the content and a separate list-item inline box.</p>
        <p>A single value of list-item will cause the element to behave like a list item. This can be used together with
            list-style-type and list-style-position.</p>
        <p>list-item can also be combined with any display-outside keyword and the flow or flow-root display-outside
            keywords.</p>
        <p class="warning">In browsers that support the two-value syntax, if no inner value is specified it will default
            to flow. If no outer value is specified, the principal box will have an outer display type of block.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Internal</h3>
        <p>display-internal</p>
        <p>Some layout models such as table and ruby have a complex internal structure, with several different roles
            that their children and descendants can fill. This section defines those "internal" display values, which
            only have meaning within that particular layout mode.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>table-row-group</dt>
            <dd>tbody</dd>
            <dt>table-header-group</dt>
            <dd>thead</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>.....</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Box</h3>
        <p>display-box</p>
        <p>These values define whether an element generates display boxes at all.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>contents</dt>
            <dd>These elements don't produce a specific box by themselves. They are replaced by their pseudo-box and
                their child boxes. Please note that the CSS Display Level 3 spec defines how the contents value should
                affect "unusual elements" — elements that aren’t rendered purely by CSS box concepts such as replaced
                elements. See Appendix B: Effects of display: contents on Unusual Elements for more details.
                <br>
                <br>
                Due to a bug in browsers this will currently remove the element from the accessibility tree — screen
                readers will not look at what's inside. See the Accessibility concerns section below for more details.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
            <dt>none</dt>
            <dd>Turns off the display of an element so that it has no effect on layout (the document is rendered as
                though the element did not exist). All descendant elements also have their display turned off.
                <br>
                To have an element take up the space that it would normally take, but without actually rendering
                anything, use the visibility property instead.
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Legacy</h3>
        <p>display-legacy</p>
        <p>CSS 2 used a single-keyword syntax for the display property, requiring separate keywords for block-level and
            inline-level variants of the same layout mode.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>inline-block</dt>
            <dd>The element generates a block element box that will be flowed with surrounding content as if it were a
                single inline box (behaving much like a replaced element would).
                <br>
                It is equivalent to inline flow-root.
            </dd>
            <dl>
                <dt>inline-table</dt>
                <dd>he inline-table value does not have a direct mapping in HTML. It behaves like an HTML table element,
                    but as an inline box, rather than a block-level box. Inside the table box is a block-level context.
                    <br>
                    It is equivalent to inline table.
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <dt>inline-flex</dt>
                <dd>The element behaves like an inline element and lays out its content according to the flexbox model.
                    <br>
                    It is equivalent to inline flex.
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <dt>inline-grid</dt>
                <dd>The element behaves like an inline element and lays out its content according to the grid model.
                    <br>
                    It is equivalent to inline grid.
                </dd>
            </dl>
        </dl>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Which syntax should you use now?</h3>
        <p>The Level 3 specification details two values for the display property — enabling the specification of the
            outer and inner display type explicitly — but this is not yet well-supported by browsers.</p>
        <p>The display-legacy methods allow the same results with single keyword values, and should be favoured by
            developers until the two keyword values are better supported. For example, using two values you might
            specify an inline flex container as follows:</p>
        <code>.container {
            display: inline flex;
          }</code>
        <p>This can currently be specified using a single value.</p>
        <code>.container {
            display: inline-flex;
          }</code>
        <p>For more information on these changes to the specification, see the article Adapting to the new two-value
            syntax of display.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Global</h3>
        <code>
            /* Global values */
display: inherit;
display: initial;
display: unset;
        </code>
    </section>
