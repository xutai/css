            spacing and layout

            Normally, table columns tend to be sized according to how much content they contain, 
            which produces some strange results.
            
            talbe-layout: fixed
                size your columns according to the width of their headings, and then deal with their content as appropriate
                thead th:nth-child(n)
                it makes the table behave a bit more predictably by default.

            some simple typography

            google fonts, not for china!
            alibaba fonts, etc

            tweaking the font styling to make things easier to read:

            By default, cells are given a text-align value of left, and headings are given a value of center,
            but generally it looks better to have the alignments set the same for both.

            It is useful to have multiple nested elements available so you can layer styles on top of one another.

            for the benefit of older browsers that don't support multiple background images or linear gradients.
            we decided to do it separately instead of
            putting both the background image and the linear gradient on the elements using multiple background images
