            background:
            when background-image + background-color exist, background-image will be in higher layer
        
            background-size:
            cover vs contain
                aspect ratio: yes vs yes
                difference: 
                    cover: bg image cover the box while extra area might remain outside of the box 
                        (width and height) keep stretching until both (width and height) cover the box
                    contain: the box contain the bg image
                        it either fills left-right or top-bottom, then do nothing
                        (width and height) keep stretching until either (width or height) cover the box
        
        
                        
            ---------------------------
            background-image: image1, image2
            layer: image1(higher layer) image2(lower layer)
            
            ---------------------------
            multiple values:
            
            properties and positions, they repeat to match
            
            property1: value1-1, value1-2, value1-3, value1-4
            property2: value2-1, value2-2
            => value1-2,value1-3 with value2-1; value1-2,value1-3 with value2-2
            property3: value3-1, value3-2, value3-3
            => value1-1,value1-4 with value 3-1, value1-2 with value 3-2, value1-3 with value 3-3
            
            in this case,property1 should be background-image

        <div class="attachment attachment1">Causes the element's background to scroll when the page is scrolled. If the
            element content is scrolled, the background does not move. In effect, the background is fixed to the same
            position on the page, so it scrolls as the page scrolls.</div>
        <div class="attachment attachment2">Causes an element's background to be fixed to the viewport, so that it
            doesn't scroll when the page or element content is scrolled. It will always remain in the same position on
            the screen.</div>
        <div class="attachment attachment3">This value was added later on (it is only supported in Internet Explorer 9+,
            whereas the others are supported in IE4+) because the scroll value is rather confusing and doesn't really do
            what you want in many cases. The local value fixes the background to the element it is set on, so when you
            scroll the element, the background scrolls with it.</div>

        <p>这个值是后来添加的(它只在Internet Explorer
            9+中受支持，而其他的在IE4+中受支持)，因为滚动值相当混乱，在很多情况下并不能真正实现您想要的功能。局部值将背景固定在设置的元素上，因此当您滚动元素时，背景也随之滚动。</p>
