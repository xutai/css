        <h2>tips to keep your css tidy</h2>

        <h3>does your project have a coding style guide</h3>
        <pre>
            maybe follow mdn's coding style is a good choice
        </pre>

        <h3>keep it consistent</h3>
        <pre>
            !important
            i've been doing on this badly

            Consistency 
                using the same naming conventions for classes
                choosing one method of describing color
                maintaining consistent formatting
                    for example will you use tabs or spaces to indent your code? 
                    If spaces, how many spaces?
        </pre>

        <h3>formatting readable css</h3>
        <pre>
            Some developers put all of the rules onto a single line
            Other developers prefer to break everything onto a new line
                i prefer this way
                CSS doesn't mind which one you use. 
                We mdn developers personally find it is more readable to have 
                each property and value pair on a new line.
        </pre>

        <h3>comment your css</h3>
        <pre>
            add a block of comments between logical sections, 
                to help locate different sections quickly when scanning through
                or even give you something to search for to jump right into that part of the CSS
                for example: "||"

            What you should comment are the things where you made a particular decision for a reason
                You may have used a CSS property in a specific way to get around older browser incompatibilities

            add the URL of the tutorial to the comments
            
        </pre>

        <h3>create logical sections in your stylesheet</h3>
        <pre>
            !important 

            common styling | general styles
                have all of the common styling first in the stylesheet.
                body,
                h1, h2, h3, h4, h5
                ul and ol
                the talbe properies
                links
            utility classes
                for example a class that removes the default list style for lists 
                we're going to display as flex items or in some other way.
            sitewide
                the basic page layout, the header, navigation styling
            store pages
                specific things, broken down by the context, page or even component in which they are used
        </pre>

        <h3>avoid overly-specific selectors</h3>
        <pre>
            very specific selectors
                duplicate chunks of your CSS to apply the same rules to another element
            simple class
                apply that anywhere

            There will be times when making something more specific makes sense,
            however this will generally be an exception rather than usual practice.
            === 
            very specific selectors (exception)
            simple class (usual practice)
        </pre>

        <h3>break large stylesheets into multiple smaller ones</h3>
        <pre>
            very different styles for distinct parts of the site
                a stylesheet that includes all the global rules
                smaller ones that include the specific rules needed for those sections
        </pre>

        <h2>other tools that can help</h2>

        <h3>css methodologies</h3>
        <pre>
            prefer 
                adopting one of the approaches already designed by the community and tested across many projects
            rather than
                come up with your own rules for writing CSS
        </pre>
        <h4>oocss</h4>
        <pre>
            concept of Object Oriented CSS (OOCSS)
                separate your CSS into reusable objects, 
                which can be used anywhere you need on your site

            create custom CSS for the different places this pattern is used


            reusing CSS (like overriding)


            The work that Nicole Sullivan did in describing this approach and promoting it means that 
            even people who are not strictly following an OOCSS approach today
            will generally be reusing CSS in this way
            it has entered our understanding as a good way to approach things in general
        </pre>
        <h4>bem</h4>
        <pre>
            block element modifier
                a block is a standalone entity such as a button, menu, or logo
                An element is something like a list item or a title that is tied to the block it is in
                A modifier is a flag on a block or element that changes the styling or behavior

                extensive use of dashes and underscores in the CSS classes
                strict naming conventions of BEM

            widely used in larger web projects and many people write their CSS in this way
        </pre>
        <h4>other common systems</h4>
        <pre>
            The disadvantage of using such a system is that 
            they can seem overly complex, especially for smaller projects.
        </pre>

        <h3>build systems for css</h3>
        <pre>
            tooling
                pre-processors
                    A pre-processor runs over your raw files and turns them into a stylesheet,
                    sass
                post-processors
                    post-processor takes your finished stylesheet and does something to it 
                    — perhaps to optimize it in order that it will load faster.

                require that your development environment can run the scripts
                Many code editors can do this for you
                or you can install command line tools to help.
        </pre>
        <h4>defining variables</h4>
        <pre>
            without sass vs sass
            cons:
            CSS now has native custom properties, making this feature increasingly less important,
            pros:
            define all of the colors and fonts used in a project as settings, 
            then use that variable around the project
            This means that if you realise you have used the wrong shade of blue, 
            you only need change it in one place.
        </pre>
        <h4>compiling component stylesheets</h4>
        <pre>
            without sass vs sass
            organise CSS is to break down stylesheets into smaller stylesheets |
            take this to another level and have lots of very small stylesheets
            — even going as far as having a separate stylesheet for each component

            partials 局部模板
            check the example
            codepen practice

        </pre>
        <h4>post-processing for optimization</h4>
        <pre>
            a post-processing step could be to optimize the CSS by 
            stripping out anything unnecessary in the production version

            f you are concerned about adding size to your stylesheets by 
            adding a lot of additional comments and whitespace for example
