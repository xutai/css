    <h2>the dom versus view source</h2>
    <pre>
        the dom | view source
        In the rendered DOM the browser may have corrected some badly-written HTML for you
        The browser will also normalize all of the HTML, and the DOM will also show any changes made by JavaScript.
        |
        View Source in comparison, is simply the HTML source code as stored on the server. 


        The HTML tree in your DevTools shows exactly what the browser is rendering at any given time,
         so it gives you an insight into what is really going on.
