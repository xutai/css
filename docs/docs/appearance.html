    <p>The appearance CSS property is used to display an element using platform-native styling, based on the operating system's theme. The -moz-appearance and -webkit-appearance properties are non-standard versions of this propery, used (respectively) by Gecko (Firefox) and by WebKit-based (e.g., Safari) and Blink-based (e.g., Chrome, Opera) browsers to achieve the same thing. Note that Firefox and Edge also support -webkit-appearance, for compatibility reasons.</p>
