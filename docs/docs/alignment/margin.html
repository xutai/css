        <h3>Horizontal centering</h3>
        <p>To center something horizontally in modern browsers, you can use display: flex; justify-content: center; .</p>
        <p>However, in older browsers like IE8-9 that do not support Flexible Box Layout, these are not available.</p>
        <p> In order to center an element inside its parent, use margin: 0 auto;.</p>

        <h3>margin collapsing</h3>
        <p>Elements' top and bottom margins are sometimes collapsed into a single margin that is equal to the larger of the two margins. </p>
