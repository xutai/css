    <p>A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s). For example, ::first-line can be used to change the font of the first line of a paragraph.</p>
    <p class="warning">In contrast to pseudo-elements, pseudo-classes can be used to style an element based on its state.</p>
